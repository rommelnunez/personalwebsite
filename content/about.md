Hi there! I am Rommel Nunez, a senior at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences where I am studying Computer Science and film. I have always been passionate about mentorship and teaching. I have had the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant for two of Columbia's largest undergraduate Computer Science courses for the last 6 semesters and as head teaching assistant for the last 2. In addition to my studies, I have gained valuable industry experience through internships as a Product Manager at a health-tech startup and as a Data Engineer at JP Morgan Chase & Co. Outside of my technical pursuits, I have pursued my creative interests by writing, directing, and producing over 10 music videos and serving as the director of photography for a short film. I am excited to continue learning and growing in both my technical and creative endeavors, and I am eager to use my diverse background to revolutionize how entertainment is consumed!
